Create a complete multi-page responsive website for a technology engineering company named CODESCAPE.

This is not a basic landing page. The goal is to build a premium digital presence that communicates reliability, scalability, and engineering thinking. The experience should feel closer to a software platform than a marketing template.

Brand rules:

Company name must always appear as CODESCAPE (uppercase)

Tagline: “Where Creativity Meets Technology”

Tone: confident, structured, technical, trustworthy

Avoid startup/playful aesthetics and cartoon illustrations

Avoid generic templates

Design language:

Dark professional theme (charcoal / deep navy background)

Subtle blue accent color

Clean grid layout and strong spacing rhythm

Large typography hierarchy (headings carry the design)

Thin dividers and soft section separation

Minimal icons

No clipart or stock-illustration look

Premium SaaS / enterprise feel similar to modern agency websites

Interaction philosophy:
Motion should guide attention, not decorate.
Animations must be smooth and subtle, never distracting.

Include:

opacity + slight upward reveal on scroll

hover elevation on cards

magnetic button hover effect

number counters when visible

smooth section transitions

page color wipe transition between routes

lazy loading images

no heavy parallax or particle systems

no infinite auto-scroll carousels

no layout shifts

Signature hero interaction:
Instead of a technical diagram, show transformation.

Hero starts minimal with headline:
“We build reliable digital products that scale”

As user scrolls:
abstract UI elements assemble into a structured interface layout
(idea → organized product concept)

Final hero state displays:
YOUR SUCCESS IS OUR MISSION

This should visually communicate turning ideas into production systems.

Tech stack:
Use React + TailwindCSS + Framer Motion + React Router
Component based architecture
Reusable layout components
Clean folder structure

Performance requirements:
Mobile-first responsive design
Optimized images
Minimal JS on initial load
Fast first paint
No horizontal scrolling
Lazy load heavy sections

Site architecture (multi page):

Home

high impact hero with assembling interface animation

client logo strip

services preview cards

featured case study highlight

testimonials section

final CTA section

Services (main page)

grid of service modules

each card leads to detail page

Service detail pages
structure:

Additional required sections:

Visual behavior:
Sections should feel like slides
Alternate subtle background tones
Full-width layouts
Comfortable spacing
Typography dominant

Coding style:
Well structured components
Readable naming
Reusable UI components (Card, Section, Container, Heading, Button)
Separate layout and pages

Goal:
The final result should feel like a premium engineering partner website that demonstrates capability instead of describing it. It must look production-ready and not like a student project.
